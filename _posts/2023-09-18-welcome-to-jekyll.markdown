Hello, this is Sam. I am a QA Engineer with 4 years of experience who hopes to eventually transition to coding. That's where the github page and DevLog come into play. I am currently working in the gaming industry and would like to continue doing so, as the only way to stay in the industry is to constantly improve your skills.

I began learning C# about 6 months ago and later added C++. This page primarily contains learning notes, my leetcode solution, and discussions about Game Engines and Technologies. Please excuse my broken English. Sometimes I might go wrong or my explaination might be bad. Please feel free to correct me in those instances.

I hope to be able to assist you all in some way. Happy Studying!!
